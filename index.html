						<h1>About me</h1>
						
						<p>I enjoy exploring the world of entertainment through movies, TV shows, and anime. I also like to spend time reading and
						listening to podcasts as a form of relaxation. As a hobby, I participate in theater, finding it to be a space for
						expression and enjoyment.
						
						I value both prepared and spontaneous humor, finding laughter to be a beautiful way to connect with others. I relish
						conversations in bars and coffee shops with friends and acquaintances, where we exchange ideas on various social,
						cultural, political, and musical topics. My interest in social structures and how they function also leads me to delve
						into these subjects, seeking a better understanding of our environment and its impact on our lives.
						
						I believe in the sense of community and the importance of empathy and spaces for reflection in creating a healthier and
						more connected environment. These values guide my approach both personally and professionally.</p>
